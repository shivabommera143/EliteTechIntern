## üìå About the Project

This project builds a neural network model (BiLSTM) using TensorFlow to classify news headlines from the HuffPost dataset into one of the top 10 most common categories.

The full pipeline includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Text vectorization using TensorFlow's `TextVectorization`
- Model training using a Bidirectional LSTM
- Evaluation with classification report and confusion matrix
- Interactive predictions from user input
